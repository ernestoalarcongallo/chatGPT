# OpenAI Chatbot

This is a simple Flask app that allows users to chat with an OpenAI-powered chatbot. 
Users can input a question, and the chatbot will generate a response based on its training.
The model used is the `text-davinci-002`, and there's a limitation of tokens on the model's response to
1024 tokens.

Please find this app no more than a proof of concept.
